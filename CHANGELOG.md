# Changelog

## v3.6.5 (2026-06-16)
- Fix: event toasts (goal / card notifications) now reliably subscribe — `connectedCallback` fires before `hass` is available in HA; subscription now triggered from `updated()` on first `hass`, with guard against duplicate subscriptions

## v3.6.4 (2026-06-16)
- Live Match: stats built from `home_statistics`/`away_statistics` (all stats visible, not just 4)
